Hello :=),



I created this to demonstrate my knowledge of responsive HTML, CSS, JQuery, consuming REST Web API's,
and the software patterns MVC, Abstract Factory Method, and Facade. I am not an expert PHP
developer, I just learned enough to complete this demo. 



One of my strengths however, is the love for learning. I love to read and learn knew software techniques, 
but I tend to only do this as needed or as inspired. This project doesn't use a database, instead it consumes two different free REST API services. Hope you like it :=)







Info:

The folder \NetBeansIDE_8.2 Project folder\PhpDemo should be placed in your netbeans projects folder.

The folder \Wamp_Server_3.0.6_64bit www folder\PHPDemo should be placed in your wamp server www folder.

You will have to update the "Project folder" and "Source Folder" settings in the Project Properties to point to your
local paths.
